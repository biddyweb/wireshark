commit 4413725
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Thu Sep 11 13:29:37 2014 -0700

    Add some additional checks in SnifferDecompress().
    
    Check the input pointer in the while clause of the loop, so that we
    handle an empty input buffer.
    
    When reading a bit mask, check before fetching the bit mask that we have
    two bytes of bit mask and the byte after it.
    
    Before putting an uncompressed input byte into the output, make sure we
    wouldn't run past the end of the output buffer.
    
    Before copying an earlier string from the output buffer, make sure it
    doesn't run past the end of the data we've decompressed so far.

    Increase the error buffer size for rpcap.
    
    If the rpcap port is unreachable pcap_findalldevs_ex can write more
    than PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE bytes to errbuf. E.g. if we try to capture from
    Google's all-eights public DNS server we get:
    
    ----
    Can't get list of interfaces: Is the server properly installed on 8.8.8.8?
    connect() failed: A connection attempt failed because the connected
    party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established
    connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.  (code 1
    ----
    
    Set the buffer to PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE*4 bytes. Hopefully that's large enough.

    Hack to fix RTP player progress line position
    
    PortAudio seems to return 0 as value for Pa_GetStreamTime() on
    a PulseAudio system using the ALSA host API. This is known for 3 years,
    but still has not been fixed. As this function basically gives us a
    monotonically increasing clock in seconds as double, just use the Glib
    library function for that. I don't know whether this adds much latency,
    but it is certainly better than breaking the progress line (and also
    the related auto-scroll).
    
    While at it, split the idx calculation and explain what each part does
    and add modelines. Remove invalid _U_ annotations.

    This will, at least, make it show up as the meaning of a field

    hip: fix infinite loop in dissect_hip_tlv
    
    We can't use tree_item == NULL to determine which branch of the previous if was
    hit, since proto_tree_add_item can return NULL when run without tree, which was
    leading to an infinite loop since we were never advancing the offset. Use the
    actual locator_type instead.
    
    Introduced by either g3635d7bed70 or gebff85fdbb although neither of them
    directly touch this code path. I'm guess that g3635d7bed70 removed an if (tree)
    guard in some calling function which would have prevented this, but I haven't
    checked. The bug would still have been there before, it just wouldn't have been
    hit because it's only present with a NULL tree. Somebody more familiar with the
    protocol should probably go over a capture or two and make sure this isn't a
    symptom of some other decoding gone awry in the recent changes.

Date:   Thu Jul 24 15:32:55 2014 +0100

    Fix support for decrypting 802.11 broadcast messages.
    
    A little bit of guess work is involved as the group key can use a
    different cipher to the pairwise key, and we are trying to do this
    purely based on the EAPOL messages with no prior knowledge of the
    associate request. We try to guess the cipher based on the lengths.

      (which messed up TCP sequence number analysis).
    - hislip Request/Response analysis must be done during 'pass1'
      (i.e. when 'flags.visited == 0');
      Not doing so caused various problems including

    - Remove 'if (tree)' around a call to expert_...().
    - Don't show "unknown" for Async/Sync when the value is actually known.
    - Simplify some code.
    - Mark a field as GENERATED.

    Rename buffer_ routines to tagbuffer_ to avoid name collisions.
    
    In particular, collisions with the buffer_ routines in libwsutil; in the
    trunk, we renamed *those* routines, but that breaks API/ABI
    compatibility, so, in the 1.12 branch, we rename these routines, which
    adds a difference between this code and the Lrexlib release that we'd
    rather not have if we can avoid it.
    
    This should fix bug 10332.

    Use packet_scope instead of a stack local
    
    As clang pointed out we end up storing a reference to it in a global and (more
    relevantly) pushing that global to a tap which would run after the current frame
    has returned.
    
    Thanks to Alexis for bringing this to my attention.

commit 506e8f6
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Wed Jul 30 16:41:51 2014 -0700

    Add some files under asn1 to the distribution.
    
    Include CMakeLists.txt files and the gnm subdirectory, along with the
    top-level Makefile.inc and Makefile.preinc files.  Don't explicitly
    include Custom.make, as automake does that automatically given that it's
    included by asn1/Makefile.am.
    
    Add some files to EXTRA_DIST lists.
    
    Move some .asn files to EXTRA_DIST; they don't need to be in SRC_FILES,
    as SRC_FILES always includes EXTRA_DIST, and they *do* need to be in
    EXTRA_DIST so that they're in the distribution.
